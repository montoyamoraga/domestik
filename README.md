## About

Software design and development by Aarón Montoya-Moraga and Guillermo Montecinos, for domestik performance directed by María José Contreras

This software allows every performer on stage to livestream from their mobile phones to a computer, where the director can choose which camera (frontal/rear) to use on every phone, can apply effects (black and white filter) and can decide which feed is shown to the audience (1, 2 or 3 cameras at the same time.)

## Technology

This software runs on a Macbook pro with [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) and the library ipcapture.

It supports up to 3 iPhones transmitting at the same time, using the app Ipcamera.
